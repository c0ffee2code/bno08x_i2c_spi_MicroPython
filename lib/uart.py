Subclass of `BNO08X` to use UART

To select UART-SHTP, PS1 must be high "1" and PS0/WAKE must be ground "0".
This driver does not support UART-RVC mode. This means for UART operation reqires wake_pin is None, wake_pin=None

1.2.3.1 UART operation: "Bytes sent from the host to the BNO08X must be separated by at least 100μs.
Bytes sent from the BNO to the host have no extra spacing."

The INT pin signifies when the UART data is to be sent:
6.5.4 Interrupt timing: In UART-SHTP mode the interrupt is asserted prior to the UART transmission. It is assumed that the host can
always accept data over its UART. The interrupt is asserted approx. 7.7 µs prior to the first bit of UART
transmission. The interrupt will be de-asserted prior to the termination of the UART transmission.

1. The H_INTN pin is driven low prior to the initial byte of UART transmission. It will deassert and reassert
between messages. It is used by the host to timestamp the beginning of data transmission.
2. NRST is the reset line for the BNO08X and can be either driven by the application processor or the board
reset.

Baud Rate: 3_000_000 baud (~3.3μs/byte), if the BNO08x is sending bytes back-to-back,
the maximum delay between 2 consecutive bytes should be only a few microseconds.
However, the BNO08x might have internal processing delays for assembling a long report. set delay=5ms.
uart = UART(1, baudrate=3_000_000, tx=Pin(8), rx=Pin(9), timeout=50)
uart = UART(0, baudrate=3_000_000, tx=Pin(12), rx=Pin(13), timeout=50)

6.5.3 Startup timing
The timing for BNO08X startup for I2C and SPI modes uses Reset & Interrupt.
The host may begin communicating with the BNO08X after it has asserted high on INT.
In UART mode, the BNO08X sends an advertisement message when it is ready to communicate.
