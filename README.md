# bno08x-i2c-spi-micropython
## Micropython I2C SPI library BNO08X sensors for 9-axis fusion

bno08x MicroPython driver for I2C, SPI, UART on MicroPython. This is for the BNO086, BNO085, and BNO080. The BNO08x sensors have a variety of sensors that can provide data/results.
Each of these are accessed individually and called reports.

This driver is written to provide to respond to high-frequency reports (short period), and also provides 0.1 msec resolution 
timestamps for each sensor report. Knowing IMU results together with timestamp of results is critical for many
telemetry applications.  

This driver requires that the int_pin and reset_pin be connected to the sensors for operation.

This library has been tested with BNO086 sensor on Raspberry Pico 2 W. 

The report frequency will be limited by the interface chosen. 
SPI is the fastest and SPI is 30% faster than I2c. 
SPI avoids the bno08x's non-standard I2C clock stretching which occurs during fast operations or many reports.
I2C Clock Stretching causes IO errors in these cases.
SPI is also ?x faster than UART. Choose the report rate and interface that meets your needs.

## Setting up to use the Sensor

### I2C Setup

    # import the library
    from i2c import BNO08X_I2C
    from bno08x import *

    # set up the  I2C bus
    int_pin = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)  # BNO sensor (INT)
    reset_pin = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)  # BNO sensor (RST)

    i2c0 = I2C(0, scl=Pin(13), sda=Pin(12), freq=400_000)

    # set up the BNO sensor on I2C
    bno = BNO08X_I2C(i2c0, address=0x4b, int_pin=int_pin, reset_pin=reset_pin)

Required for I2C (see SPI and UART below):
- address : each BNO08x needs a separate address (0x4b or 0x4a, depending on solder bump).
- int_pin : required for operation and also gives accurate sensor timestamps. Define a Pin object, not  number.
- reset_pin : required for operation after sensor power up. It is a Pin object, not number

Optional parameters:
- debug : prints very detailed logs, primarily for driver debug & development.


    bno = BNO08X_I2C(i2c0, address=0x4b, int_pin=int_pin, reset_pin=reset_pin, debug=True)

The maximum clock frequency for i2c is 400_000 (~400kbs). PS0 (wake_pin) and PS1 are used to select I2C.
To use I2C, both PS0 and PS1 can not have solder blobs which means both are tied to ground. I2C can not use wake_pin.

## Enable the sensor reports

Before getting sensor report, each specific report must be enabled.

    bno.enable_feature(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER)
    
Primary sensor report constants:

        BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER
        BNO_REPORT_GYROSCOPE
        BNO_REPORT_MAGNETOMETER
        BNO_REPORT_LINEAR_ACCELERATION
        BNO_REPORT_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_GRAVITY
        BNO_REPORT_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_STEP_COUNTER
        BNO_REPORT_SHAKE_DETECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_STABILITY_CLASSIFIER
        BNO_REPORT_ACTIVITY_CLASSIFIER

BNO08x documentation uses the words "ROTATION_VECTOR", and we honor that in several of the constants above. 
Most people refer to these as quaternions, which is easier to understand in code.
In this library, we use bno.quaternion and enable it with "BNO_REPORT_ROTATION_VECTOR".
Likewise, when bno.game_quaternion is used, please enable it with "BNO_REPORT_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR".

## Getting the sensor results:

Sensors values can be accessed with:

    accel_x, accel_y, accel_z = bno.acceleration

Roll, tilt, and yaw are obtained using quaternion with the modifier euler:

    roll, tilt, yaw = bno.quaternion.euler

The sensor data and metadata for each report can be accessed at the same time using ".full".
In this way, the accuracy and the microsecond-accurate timestamp of a particular report is returned at the same time.
The timestamp_us is synchronized with the host's usec time. Understanding timestamps is recommended for
high-frequency applications (>5Hz).

    accel_x, accel_y, accel_z, accuracy, timestamp_us = bno.acceleration.full
    roll, tilt, yaw, accuracy, timestamp_us = bno.quaternion.euler_full   # note underscore in .euler_full

The metadata (accuracy, timestamp) can be separately accessed, but due to timing of the calls they may be from a different report.
Using .full is recommended.

    accuracy, timestamp_us = bno.acceleration.meta

If you are using quaternions for various processing and at a later time you want to convert to an euler angle (degrees),
you can use the following conversion function:

    i, j, k, r = bno.quaternion

    # ...various quaternion processing

    roll, pitch, yaw = euler_conversion(new_i, new_j, new_k, new_r)

**Examples of other sensor reports**

The examples directory shows the use of the following sensor reports. Each of these functions use on-chip sensor fusion for accuracy.

    x, y, z = bno.acceleration          # acceleration 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned (gravity direction included)
    x, y, z = bno.linear_acceleration   # linear accel 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.gyro                  # gryoscope 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.magnetic              # magnetic 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.gravity               # gravity vector 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    roll, pitch, yaw = bno.quaternion.euler     # rotation degree angle in Euler orientation 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned

    i, j, k, real = bno.quaternion              # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned
    i, j, k, real = bno.geomagnetic_quaternion  # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned
    i, j, k, real = bno.game_quaternion         # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned

    num = bno.steps                     # number of steps since sensor initialization returned
    state = bno.shake                   # boolean of state since last read returned
    stability_str = bno.stability_classification    # string of stability classification returned
    activity_str = bno.activity_classification      # string of activity classification returned

The following functions can be used to tare and calibrate the sensor:

    bno.tare  # tare the sensor

    bno.begin_calibration  # begin calibration
    x, y, z, mag_acc, ts = bno.magnetic.full
    print(f"Magnetic Accuracy: {REPORT_ACCURACY_STATUS[mag_acc]} = {mag_acc}")
TODO FIX THIS **********************
    mag_accuracy = bno.calibration_status  # magnetic calibration status int returned
    bno.save_calibration_data  # Save calibration

## Option to Change Sensor Report Frequency

The sensor report default frequencies are 10 to 20 Hz.
You can request different frequecies and the BNO08X will pick the closest frequency it can provide.

    bno.enable_feature(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER, 40)  # enable accelerometer reports at 40 Hertz

See the seletion below (__Details on Report Frequencies__) for more details.
If your code requests faster than the report feature frequency specified, repeated values will be returned.

## Euler angles, gimbal lock, and quaternions

Euler angles have a problem with Gimbal Lock. With Euler angles, a loss of a degree of freedom occurs when two
rotational axes align, which means certain orientations have multiple representations. 
There was a famous example of this on Apollo 11.
Quaternions avoid this by providing a unique representation for every possible orientation problem.
Quaternions use several rotation around a single axis and an angle.

## I2C Issues with speed and communication errors

Unfortunately, the BNO080, BNO085, and BNO086 all use **_non-standard clock stretching_** on the I2C.
This causes a variety of issues including report errors and the need to restart sensor.
Clock stretching interferes with various chips (ex: RP2) in different ways.
If you see ETIMEDOUT, this is likely the issue (BNO08X Datasheet 1000-3927 v1.17, page 15).
Some have had good results with software I2C (emulation). We do not know how this impacts performance.

## SPI Setup - for higher speed sensor reports (no clock stretch issues)

In order to use SPI on most sensor boards one must add ONE solder blob on PS1. 
On the back side of Sparkfun BNO086 and Adafruit BNO085, one needs a solder blob to bridge PS1 which will set PS1 high for SPI operation. 
The PS0 (Wake_pin) must be connected to a gpio (wake_pin), please be careful not put a solder blog on PS0.
This driver uses the wake-pin after reset as a ‘wake’ signal taking the BNO08X out of sleep for communication with the BNO08X.
On the Sparkfun BNO086 when using SPI, one must clear i2c jumper when using SPI or UART (https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_VR_IMU_Breakout_BNO086_QWIIC/assets/board_files/SparkFun_VR_IMU_Breakout_BNO086_QWIIC_Schematic_v10.pdf)

 SPI must be set to baudrate=3_000_000 (only)

    from machine import SPI, Pin
    from spi import BNO08X_SPI
    from bno08x import *

    int_pin = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)  # BNO sensor (INT)
    reset_pin = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)  # BNO sensor (RST)
    cs_pin = Pin(17, Pin.OUT)  # cs for SPI (CS)
    wake_pin = Pin(20, Pin.OUT, value=1)  # BNO sensor (WAK)

    spi = SPI(0, sck=Pin(18), mosi=Pin(19), miso=Pin(16), baudrate=3_000_000)
    print(spi)

    bno = BNO08X_SPI(spi, cs_pin=cs_pin, int_pin=int_pin, reset_pin=reset_pin, wake_pin=wake_pin)

Required for SPI:
- int_pin : required for operation and also gives accurate sensor timestamps. Define a Pin object, not  number.
- reset_pin : required for operation after sensor power up. It is a Pin object, not number
- wake_pin : required for SPI operation. 
- cs_pin : required for SPI operation.

Optional for SPI:
- debug : prints very detailed logs, primarily for driver debug & development.

## UART Setup
UART wires are in some sense opposite of i2c wires (double-check your wiring).
uart = UART(1, baudrate=3_000_000, tx=Pin(8), rx=Pin(9), timeout=2000)
uart = UART(0, baudrate=3_000_000, tx=Pin(12), rx=Pin(13), timeout=2000)

Required for UART:
- int_pin : required by UART for accurate sensor timestamps. Define a Pin object, not number.
Optional for UART:
- reset_pin : used by UART for hardware reset, if not defined uses soft reset. It is a Pin object, not number

1. BNO08x SDA to board UARTx-RX (uart 1 ex: gpio9, uart 0 ex: gpio13)
2. BNO08x SCL to board UARTx-TX (uart 1 ex: gbio8, uart 0 ex: gpio12)
3. todo ? INT Pin is required for accurate communication

PS0 and PS1 are the host interface protocol selection pins, therefore UART can not use a wake pin.  In order to use UART, PS1 must be high (solder blob) and PS0/WAKE not have solder blob so it is tied to ground.

1. must clear i2c jumper when using SPI or UART (https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_VR_IMU_Breakout_BNO086_QWIIC/assets/board_files/SparkFun_VR_IMU_Breakout_BNO086_QWIIC_Schematic_v10.pdf)
2. must have solder blob ONLY on SP1, must NOT have Wake pin connect to a pin.

## Details on Report Frequencies

Report frequencies should be enabled before requesting reports in the code.
To convert from period in ms to Hz (1000000/period_ms).

    bno.enable_feature(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER, 100)  # Enable accelerometer reports at 100 Hertz

When the frequency of the sensor is set in enable_feature, it should be viewed as a suggestion to the sensor to operate at that frequency.
If the sensor cannot operate at requested period, it may operate faster or slower (SH-2 datasheet 5.4.1 Rate Control).
For example, we've seen a request of 100 Hz and have had the sensor report at 125Hz.
With multiple reports we've also seen 20 Hz changed to 10 Hz.

| **Feature**             | **Max Frequency (Hz)** | **msec/Report** | **period we've seen**  |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Composite Gyro Rotation | 1000? (only 500)       | 1.0 ms          | 1 ms                   |
| Accelerometer           | 500                    | 2.0 ms          | 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64... |
| Rotation Vector         | 400                    | 2.5 ms          |                        |
| Gaming Rotation         | 400                    | 2.5 ms          | 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60  |
| Gravity                 | 400                    | 2.5 ms          |                        |
| Linear Acceleration     | 400                    | 2.5 ms          |                        |
| Gyroscope               | 400                    | 2.5 ms          | 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60  |
| Magnetometer            | 100                    | 10.0 ms         | 10, 20, 40, 50, 60,    |
| Geomagnetic Rotation    | 90                     | 11.1 ms         |                        |
| raw Gyroscope           |                        |                 | 10, 20, 40, 50, 60     |
| raw Magnetometer        |                        |                 | 50, 60,                |
| raw Accelerometer       |                        |                 | 32, 64, 96             |
| (report default)        | 20                     | 50.0 ms         |                        |

There is also a print function (slow) that shows all enabled reports by printing to the console.

    bno.print_report_period()

You can also access the values of report frequencies. This function returns the sensors native values in usec (microseconds),
but you can easily convert them to msec (milliseconds). The actual sensor period will vary from the attempted period
returned by this function.

    accelerometer_period_us = bno.report_period_us(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER)
    period_ms = accelerometer_period_us / 1000.0
    print(f"Accelerometer: {period_ms:.1f} ms, {1_000 / period_ms:.1f} Hz")

Currently On Pico 2 W, the SPI interface can almost service 2ms reports. 
The fastest updates we've seen on SPI is 3.1 ms (322Hz), I2C is slower at 4.0ms (250Hz).  
When one request report frequencies at faster than the microcontroler can service, the period the reporting frequency will slow.
Try you own experiments and let me know what you find.

Refer to the BNO080_085-Datasheet.pdf (page 50) for Maximum sensor report rates by report type.

## Calibration of the Sensor

## Raw Reports - Be Careful
    BNO_REPORT_RAW_ACCELEROMETER
    BNO_REPORT_RAW_GYROSCOPE
    BNO_REPORT_RAW_MAGNETOMETER

The raw reports, which do not use sensor fusion calculations, are also implemented in this driver for acceleration,
magnetic, and gyro sensors. It is not generally recommended to use these reports, and they require signficant math (careful
calibaration, Kalman filters, etc.). Please read all references below when attempting to use raw reports.
In addition, there are other sensor reports possible with the bno08x sensors that this driver has not fully
implemented. See code and references for details. The timestamps are not well-documented in Ceva documentation.

## UART-RVC is NOT SUPPORTED by this driver (RVC, Robot Vacuum Cleaners)

The BNO08X has a simplified UART interface for use on unmanned ground roving robot and robot vacuum cleaners (RVC).
This is a very different protocol and not supported in my driver. Take a look at: https://github.com/rdagger/micropython-bno08x-rvc
