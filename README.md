## Library tested

bno08x MicroPython driver for i2c, spi, uart on MicroPython

This library has been tested with BNO086 sensor. It should work with BNO080 and BNO085 sensors. It has been tested with Raspberry Pico 2 W

## Setting up the Driver

### I2C

    #import the library
    from i2c import BNO08X_I2C
    from bno08x import BNO_REPORT_GYROSCOPE, BNO_REPORT_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR, BNO_REPORT_MAGNETOMETER, BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER

    #setup the  I2C bus
    i2c0 = I2C(0, scl=Pin(13), sda=Pin(12), freq=100_000, timeout=200_000)

    #setup the BNO sensor
    bno = BNO08X_I2C(i2c0, address=0x4b)

Optional parameters: 

    bno = BNO08X_I2C(i2c0, address=0x4b, reset_pin=Pin(12), int_pin==Pin(13), debug=False)

- address : if using 2 BNO08x you need set each up separately (depending on board, add solder jump or cut wire)
- reset_pin : required to enable sensor hard reset (Pin object not number). If not defined, a soft reset will be used.
- int_pin : required to time synchronize sensor and host to enable microsecond accuracy timestamps. Define a Pin object. Not required if only 200-millisecond host-based timestamps are adequate, or if timestamps are not required.
- debug : print very detailed logs, mainly for debugging driver

## Enable the sensor reports

Before getting sensor results the reports must be enabled:

    bno.enable_feature(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER)  # for accelerometer
    
Primary sensor reports:

        BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER
        BNO_REPORT_GYROSCOPE
        BNO_REPORT_MAGNETOMETER
        BNO_REPORT_LINEAR_ACCELERATION
        BNO_REPORT_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_GRAVITY
        BNO_REPORT_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_STEP_COUNTER
        BNO_REPORT_SHAKE_DETECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_STABILITY_CLASSIFIER
        BNO_REPORT_ACTIVITY_CLASSIFIER

Additional reports:

        BNO_REPORT_RAW_ACCELEROMETER
        BNO_REPORT_RAW_GYROSCOPE
        BNO_REPORT_RAW_MAGNETOMETER
        BNO_REPORT_UNCALIBRATED_GYROSCOPE
        BNO_REPORT_UNCALIBRATED_MAGNETOMETER
        BNO_REPORT_ARVR_STABILIZED_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_ARVR_STABILIZED_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR
        BNO_REPORT_GYRO_INTEGRATED_ROTATION_VECTOR

There are additional sensor reports that this driver has not fully implemented. See code and references for details.

## Getting the sensor results:

Sensors values can be accessed with:

    accel_x, accel_y, accel_z = bno.acceleration

Roll, tilt, and yaw can be obtained with:

    roll, tilt, yaw = bno.euler

**Examples of other sensor reports**

See examples directory for sample code. The following functions use on-chip sensor fusion for accuracy.

    x, y, z = bno.acceleration  # acceleration 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.linear_acceleration  # linear accel 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.gyro  # acceleration 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.magnetic  # acceleration 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    roll, pitch, yaw = bno.euler  # rotation 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    x, y, z = bno.gravity  # vector 3-tuple of x,y,z float returned
    i, j, k, real = bno.quaternion  # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned
    i, j, k, real = bno.geomagnetic_quaternion  # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned
    i, j, k, real = bno.game_quaternion  # rotation 4-tuple of i,j,k,real float returned
    num = bno.steps  # number of steps since initialization returned
    state = bno.shake  # boolean of state since last read returned
    stability_str = bno.stability_classification  # string of stability classification returned
    activity_str = bno.activity_classification  # string of activity classification returned

The following functions can be used to tare, calibrate, and test the sensor:

    bno.tare  # tare the sensor

    bno.begin_calibration  # begin calibration
    mag_accuracy = bno.calibration_status  # magnetic calibration status int returned
    print(f"Mag Calibration: {REPORT_ACCURACY_STATUS[mag_accuracy]} = {mag_accuracy}")
    bno.save_calibration_data  # Save calibration

    status = bno.ready  # test sensor status, boolean returned

The following functions provide raw values directly from individual sensors, they lack the advanced on-sensor software that make the above functions more accurate:

    # raw data sensor tuple of x,y,z, float and time_stamp int returned
    x, y, z, usec = bno.raw_acceleration
    x, y, z, usec = bno.raw_magnetic
    
    # raw data gyro tuple of x,y,z, celsius float, and time_stamp int returned
    x, y, z, temp_c, usec = bno.raw_gyro

## Option to Change Sensor Report Frequency

The default sensor report frequency is 20 Hz. The number of reports per second that the BNO08X can reliably deliver is dependent on the interface bandwidth
and the number of reports that a BNO08X is asked to generate. I2C will definitely limit this frequency (est 10 to 50 Hz with a few reports). One should consider SPI for higher frequencies.
Refer to the BNO080_085-Datasheet.pdf (page 50) for Maximum sensor report rates by report type. Some sensor reports can be updated at 400 to 100 Hz on SPI (untested). If your code request faster than the report feature frequency specified, repeated values will be returned.

Before getting sensor results the reports must be enabled:

    bno.enable_feature(BNO_REPORT_ACCELEROMETER, 40)  # for accelerometer at 40 Hertz

## Euler angles, gimbal lock, and quaternions

Euler angles have a problem with Gimbal lock. This is where a loss of a degree of freedom occurs when two rotational axes align, which means certain orientations have multiple representations. There was a famous example of this on Apollo 11.
Quaternions avoid this problem because they represent a rotation as a single axis and an angle, providing a unique representation for every possible orientation.

## i2c Issues with speed and data quality

Unfortunately, The BNO080, BNO085, and BNO086 all use **_non-standard clock stretching_** on the i2c. This can cause a variety of issues including report errors and the need to restart sensor. Clock stretching interferes with various chips (ex: RP2) in different ways. If you see sporadic results this may be part of the issue (BNO08X Datasheet 1000-3927 v1.17, page 15).

BNO086 is backwards compatible with BNO085 and both are pin-for-pin replacements for Bosch Sensortec’s discontinued BNO055 and BMF055 sensors.
